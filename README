Description
===========

   This package provides four major sub-packages.  The SystemC::Parser
understands how to read SystemC files, and extract tokens and such,
similar to Verilog::Parser.

   SystemC::Netlist builds netlists out of SystemC files.  This allows
easy scripts to determine things such as the hiearchy of SC_MODULEs.
The netlist database may also be extended to support other languages.

   sp_preproc provides extensions to the SystemC language, called the
SystemPerl language.  This allows most of the Tedium to be removed from
SystemC coding, just as the author's /*AUTO*/ comments did for the
Verilog language.  See `man SystemPerl' after installation.

   Finally, the src directory contains useful C++ utilities for
simulation, such as changing cout to send to both the screen and a file.

   Parsing example:

         package Trialparser;
         @ISA = qw(SystemC::Parser);
     
         sub module {
             my $self = shift;
             my $module = shift;
             print $self->filename.":".$self->lineno().": ";
             print "Contains the module declaration for $module\n";
         }
     
         package main;
         my $sp = Trialparser->new();
         $sp->read ("test.sp");

   Netlist example:

       use SystemC::Netlist;
     
         my $nl = new SystemC::Netlist ();
         foreach my $file ('testnetlist.sp') {
             $nl->read_file (filename=>$file,
                             strip_autos=>1);
         }
         $nl->link();
         $nl->autos();
         $nl->lint();
         $nl->exit_if_error();
     
         foreach my $mod ($nl->modules_sorted) {
             show_hier ($mod, "  ");
         }
     
         sub show_hier {
             my $mod = shift;
             my $indent = shift;
             print $indent,"Module ",$mod->name,"\n";
             foreach my $cell ($mod->cells_sorted) {
                 show_hier ($cell->submod, $indent."  ".$cell->name."  ");
             }
         }

Obtaining Distribution
======================

   The latest version is available at `http://www.perl.org/CPAN/'

   Download the latest package from that site, and decompress.  `gunzip
SystemPerl_version.tar.gz ; tar xvf SystemPerl_version.tar'

Supported Systems
=================

   This version of SystemC has been built and tested on:

   * i386-linux

   It should run on any system with Perl and a C compiler.

Installation
============

  1. `cd' to the directory containing this INSTALL notice.

  2. Type `perl Makefile.PL' to configure SystemC for your system.
     (Note this package will probably run slower if you are still using
     perl 5.005.)

  3. Type `make' to compile SystemC.

  4. Type `make test' to check the compilation.

  5. You can see examples under the test_dir directory.  The *.sp files
     are "inline" converted, while the *.h and *.cpp files are expanded
     from the .sp files.

  6. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.

  7. Install `src/systemperl.h' somewhere in your project's build path.
     The best place is probably the $SYSTEMC/include directory.
