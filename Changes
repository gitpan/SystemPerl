Revision history for Perl extension SystemC::Netlist

The contributors that suggested a given feature are shown in [].

* SystemPerl 1.321 2009/06/04

****	Work around compiler warning when using flex 2.5.35. [Jonathan Kimmitt]

****	SP_COVERGROUP timing windows can now have options/illegal/ignore/limit
	like other coverpoints.

****	Fix test failure on 32-bit systems.  [Brennan Ashton]

* SystemPerl 1.320 2009/05/19

**	This package is now licensed under LGPL v3 and/or Artistic v2.0.

**	Verilog-Perl 3.200 or newer is required to run this version.

***	Add signal and direction regexp to AUTOINOUT_MODULE.  [Brian Cassell]

***	Include list of "use"d files in .sp_tree report.

***	Fix tracing Verilog escaped identifiers with dots getting mis-scoped.

****	Respect #sp ifdef's in coverage groups.

****	Fix warning about README on git installs.  [Brian Small]

* SystemPerl 1.311 2009/03/28

**	Created SYSTEMPERL_INCLUDE which if set allows relocating the
	src directory.

***	The systemc-mode.el provided now just calls c++-mode.  This solves
	many Emacs 22 incompatibilities, and does enough for now.

****	The README was converted into pod format to create SystemC::Manual.

****	Added SpCoverage::write data can now be filtered by a string.

****	Fix compile error with Bison 2.4.1.  [Chitlesh Goorah]

* SystemPerl 1.310 2009/01/22

**	Further refinements of coverage.  [by Robert Woods-Corwin]

**	SP_COVER_INSERT now only accepts char* keys and values.
	This prevents GCC 4.2.1 from running out of memory.

***	Support new CovVise coverage system.

****	SpCoverage dumps are now written in the faster binary format.

****	Fix parsing comments at end of "#sp ifelse" lines.  [Brian Cassell]

* SystemPerl 1.300 2008/10/01

**	Many improvements to coverage, including coverage groups and automatic
	binning - see the documentation for details.  [by Robert Woods-Corwin]

**	The SP_COVERAGE define must now be set when doing coverage.
	This accelerates compilation and run-time when not using coverage.

**	Coverage across multiple hierarchies is now compressed together,
	as per the SystemVerilog standard.  Use SP_COVER_INSERT(...,
	per_instance,1) to override this behavior.

***	Added "#sp slow" directive for splitting up large files into
	portions that can be compiled with less aggressive optimization.

****	Support more arguments to SP_COVER_INSERT.  [by Robert Woods-Corwin]

****	Fix string.h compile error.  [Rodney Sinclair]

* SystemPerl 1.281 2007/8/16

***	Support wave timestamps using uint64_t.  [John Stroebel]

****	Support wave files over 4GB using 32 bit compilers. [Brian Cassell]

***	Add vcoverage --unlink option.

****	Fix systemc-mode.el Emacs highlighting.  [Brian Cassell]

***	Allow modules not specified on the command line to be found
	automatically by using the search path (ala Verilog.)

****	SystemC::Parser now emits a separate text() callback for the text
	of a AUTO.  This allows programs to more easily replace the text inline.

****	Improve tracing to allow smaller files, rollover, inlining child traces.

* SystemPerl 1.000 2001/11/16

**	Moved Netlist guts into Verilog package,
	made SystemPerl a derived class.  This allows mixed-mode netlists.

	inclusions with sp_includer work OK.

****	Addition of experimental sclite library
	for testing package without SystemPerl installed.

* SystemPerl 0.430 2001/9/26

**	Added #sp include directive.  [Experimental, some crashes]

**	AUTOMETHODS is the new name for AUTODECLS
	AUTOMETHODS will create a SC_CTOR(__MODULE__); if there is not
	already one in the class interface.

**	AUTOTRACE uses a internal library to trace ports.
	AUTOTRACE should work on all clocks, ports, arrays, etc, and
	any simple types marked with SP_TRACED.
	AUTOTRACE requires AUTOMETHODS to be used in the class interface.

**	The #include systemperl.h at the top of all .h files has been removed.
	It must be included manually.  This allows systemperl to be used in
	non-systemc applications.

***	AUTOENUM ascii() method implementations are now put in the .cpp
	rather than the .h file.  This is indicated by a AUTOIMPLEMENTATION
	section, which is inserted automatically at the bottom of the .cpp
	file if not elsewhere in the file.

***	Detect and report unterminated strings, automodes, comment blocks.

***	Handle character constants ('a', '\0').  Handle octal and hex
	escape sequences in strings and char-constants.

***	Handle nested typenames (e.g. sc_out<ClassFoo::EnumBar>).

* SystemPerl 0.420 2001/6/27

**	Added AUTOSUBCELL_INCLUDE and AUTOSUBCELL_CLASS

**	Extracted SystemC::Template for other programs needing #line'd files.

**	Comments are now properly extracted for signals & ports.
	Note such comments must begin on the same line as the declaration.

***	Fixed extra #line statements in output files.

***	Added directional comment to /*AUTOINST*/ created pins.

***	Fixed bug with recognizing sc_inouts.  [Amir Sahar]

* SystemPerl 0.410 2001/5/21

**	Added AUTOTRACE for creating trace statements for all signals.

**	Added sp_includer and sp_makecheck for faster SystemPerl compiles.

	This is useful for hierarchical sp_preproc'essing.

* SystemPerl 0.400 2001/5/4

**	Added AUTOENUM_* for ascii displays of enum values.

**	Added SP_CTOR_IMP for constructors outside of the class decl.

**	Added SP_CELL_DECL, and allowed arrayed cell declarations.

**	Added SP_CELL_FORM for printf formatting of cell name.

**	Fixed class x {enum y}, class z {enum y} problem.

***	Fixed test on Solaris Linux.

****	The debugging dump methods are now ->dump, not ->print.

* SystemPerl 0.300 2001/4/3

**	sc_clocks are now recognized as signal declarations.

**	sc_main is considered similar to a SC_MODULE(sc_main)

****	Support Perl 5.005_003 and non-GCC

****	Many, Many bug fixes.
